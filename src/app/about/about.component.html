    The USA Pickleball Player Skill Ratings rubric provides specific skills to achieve each level of player rating. The
    rubric is distributed in PDF file format. This app digitizes the PDF rubric to make it easy for Pickleball players
    to complete skill assessment from any where and on any devices (desktop, tablet or mobile).
  </p>

  There are eight (8) rating levels. In each level, there is a set of must-have skills. Higher level requires more
  advanced skills. The rating for each skill is based on the scale A, B, C, and D.

  <ol>
    <li>level 2.0 - think of it as Pre-K</li>
    <li>level 2.5 - think of it as Kindergarten</li>
    <li>level 3.0 - think of it as Elementary School</li>
    <li>level 3.5 - think of it as Middle School</li>
    <li>level 4.0 - think of it as High School</li>
    <li>level 4.5 - think of it as 4 year Bachelor</li>
    <li>level 5.0 - think of it as Master degree</li>
    <li>level 5.5 - think of it as PhD degree</li>
  </ol>
